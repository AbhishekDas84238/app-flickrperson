====================================================
Welcome to FlickrPerson demo application for PyBossa
====================================================

PyBossa is an open source platform for crowd-sourcing online (volunteer)
assistance to perform tasks that require human cognition, knowledge or
intelligence (e.g. image classification, transcription, information location
etc). 

FlickrPerson is a demo application that asks volunteers to answer a simple question: do you see a human in this photo?

FlickrPerson grabs the latest 20 photos published in Flickr public RSS feed, and adds them as tasks into PyBossa. Then the photos are shown to the users and they can answer: yes, no or I don't know (sometimes is even too complicated for humans).
